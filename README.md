## Setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ### Prerequisites
>
> - Docker
>
> Docker will handle the dependencies such as PostgreSQL, NodeJS and NPM.
> On Windows/MacOS, I'd recommend installing the Docker GUI, as it also installs all the CLI tools, check the Docker section for more.
>
> If you're unsure about Docker at all, I highly recommend these 2 videos below, they offer most of what you need, very quickly.

### Build and Run

In the root directory, run:

```sh
$ docker compose up --build
```

Note that `docker-compose` is outdated, though still shows up on a lot of tutorials/guides. Use `docker compose` instead.

Which should result in output similar to this trimmed down reading:

```sh

The first build will take a while, caching will speed up future builds.
The Node and Postgres containers will be running, you can see them using:

```sh
$ docker ps
```

Which should show the 2 containers:

```sh
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS                   PORTS                                                 NAMES

```

When you want to restart the containers, just use `ctrl-c` on the command. If you want to delete them and completely rebuild, run `docker compose down` before running `docker compose up --build`. Note that this completely wipes any existing data in the database, which gets repopulated by the startup script.

Alternatively, you can do all this in the Docker GUI or even in your editor using the right extensions.

It is also worth noting that in the current configuration, the node server is dependant on the health check of the postgres server. In the event of a postgres failure, you can run the node server by itself with:

```sh
$ docker build -t rr-node ./node

## Database documentation

### Schema

## Testing

We are using [jest.js](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing and [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end to end testing.

Since these tests not a part of the docker container hosting, remember to `docker compose` them whilst running the e2e testing and use `npm install` to have everything up to date.

To run unit tests, simply `cd` into `node/` and run `npm test`, which should look something like this:

```sh
$ npm test
> node@0.0.0 test
> jest --verbose

 PASS  jest/report.test.js
  Report
    ✓ is built from string correctly (2 ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.243 s
Ran all test suites.
```

To run the e2e tests, again `cd` into `node/` and run `npm run e2e`. Then, a cypress window should open asking you which type of tests you want to run and on what platform. The platforms available are dependent on what you have installed on your system.

```sh
$ npm run e2e

> node@0.0.0 e2e
> cypress open

DevTools listening on ws://127.0.0.1:40929/devtools/browser/3f912fbb-1b63-4ff5-b135-1d94b7c2c915
```
